# tcpquality.py holds the two ends and the analysis of lab/tcpquality.sh. Each subcommand prints
# one line of key=value pairs.
#
#   serve <ip> <port> <bytes> <seed>
#       TCP server. A connection that sends "ping\n" gets "pong\n" and is closed; one that sends
#       "go\n" gets <bytes> of a pseudo-random stream from <seed>, then a FIN, and the server
#       prints the byte count and the stream's SHA-256.
#   fetch <ip> <port> <samplefile> <mark-bytes> <markfile>
#       sends "go\n", reads until EOF, creates <markfile> once <mark-bytes> have been read, writes
#       "<wall-clock time> <bytes>" for every read to <samplefile> and prints the byte count and
#       SHA-256 of what it read.
#   analyze <samplefile> <outage-start> <outage-end>
#       the transfer's duration and mean rate, the rate before the outage and from one second after
#       recovery to the end, the recovery time from the end of the outage to the first byte after
#       it, the stall across the outage, and the longest gap between reads outside the outage.
#       Without reads on both sides of the outage it prints undetermined=1 and no numbers.
#   median <resultfile>
#       the median of every numeric key over the result lines in <resultfile>, and how many runs
#       were undetermined.
